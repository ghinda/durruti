# Durruti

Micro Isomorphic JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Why?

Durruti aims to make isomorphic component-based JavaScript web apps easier to develop. It's focused on simplicity rather than performance.

## Features

* **Lightweight:** No dependencies, the client-side libraries are just `~4KB`.
* **No view binding:** Takes a DIY approach and lets you re-render components when needed.
* **Simple Components:** Components are basic JavaScript classes/functions with three methods.
* **Store:** Optional store library with change events and shared state between server and browser.
* **Static Site Generator:** Generate a static website from an isomorphic app.
